  /* FORMULA FOR CALCULATING PLAYER'S BATTLE STAT
  Let S = Attack or Defense skill points, based on whether the user is the attacker or defender
  Let I = The total attack/defense of the items used in the battle, based on whether the user is the attacker or defender
  Let A = The userâ€™s agency size
  Let F = The final combined stat (attack or defense)
  Then F = RAND(X * (S + I / Z), Y * (S + I / Z))
  To put it into words, we take (skill points times agency size) and add (total item stats divided by Z), and then multiply by X and Y and return a random number between those two totals.
  Note that the S and I values are already passed into the computeStat() function and the function should return F. Note also that A (agency size) should be passed into computeStat() so the function header needs to be adjusted, as do the two calls to computeStat() in backend/attackplayer.php.
